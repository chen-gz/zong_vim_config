This configuration is obsolete. Having used Vim for about a decade, I find the process of configuring it to function as an IDE to be time-consuming.

Therefore, I have created another Vim configuration repository that keeps Vim as simple as possible. It will only contain a few configurations to make Vim a good editor.
